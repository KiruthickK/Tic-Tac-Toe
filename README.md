# A simple tic tac toe game by me
A simple Tic-Tac-Toe game made using java, where our opponent is our computer. First we have the chance to choose the character 'x' or 'o',
then we move first, then computer will make its move by indices formed by random number (created again and again till its a free block in the board). Have fun
<h3> We play as 'x' and the computer is 'o'</h3>
<h3> At every move the result will be displayed</h3>
<h3> After we win or loose, we can have a option to replay</h3>
<h3> Run 'Main.java' to play the game</h3>
<h3> Have fun</h3>
